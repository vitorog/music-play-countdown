# Music Play Countdown
A browser extension that performs a countdown before playing a song in music streaming websites.

This extension was made for people who like to play their instruments along with a song from a streaming website.
The countdown gives us time to get ready before the song actually starts playing.

## Instructions:
1. Select a song to play in a web player*
2. Click on the metronome icon
3. Select the number of beats (each beat is 1 second)
4. Click on "Play" and the countdown will start
5. Finally, the song starts when the countdown finishes.

\* Right now, only Deezer and Spotify web players are supported.
